# graph

A utility to model graphs and display them _graphically_. This module allows the user to create Graph objects, which hold Node and Edge objects, to allow for modelling of graphs.

The user can then, using the DisplayGraph class, visually show and interact with the graph.

This module uses pygame to render graphs, however pygame is not needed to use simply the graph functionality.
